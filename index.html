            <p>Eating breakfast before school is essential for maintaining energy, focus, and overall well-being. A
                nutritious breakfast helps students concentrate better in class, improves memory, and provides the fuel
                needed for a productive day. Skipping breakfast can lead to fatigue, irritability, and difficulty
                staying engaged in lessons. This initiative encourages students to prioritize a healthy morning meal to
                enhance their academic performance and overall health.</p>
